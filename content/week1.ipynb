    "The process of diffusion has applications in almost every science: Darcy flow for porous media flow, electrical conduction, chemical diffusion, and, as we will discuss here, heat diffusion. All these processes can essentially be described with the same basic equation, which can be fairly easily derived. Those of you who did Further Mathematics (GEOL1081) in Year 1 will have done this before, in the form of derivation of Fick's first and second law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion equation relies on two principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Diffusion occurs in the direction of, and is proportional to, a concentration gradient. In the case of heat diffusion, heat flows from hot to cold areas, and heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient. This principle is known as Fourier's law.\n",
    "2. The amount of diffusing substance is conserved. For heat, the amount of thermal energy should be balanced; without any heat sinks or heat sources, the amount of thermal energy in a system cannot change. "
