Using $\\Delta z = 3000$ km = $3\\times 10^6$ m and $\\kappa=10^{-6}$ $\\mathrm {m^2/s}$, cooling the mantle takes approximately $\\Delta t=9 \\times 10^{18}$ s = 285 Gyrs, more than 60 times the age of the Earth. This is clearly an overestimate: Earth does not only use diffusion to transport heat, but advection as well (which expresses itself as plate tectonics, more about this later). This will speed up the cooling significantly.\n",
    "   0. The simplest way to solve this is to assume a reference frame that moves with the water, so that, in that reference frame, the water is not moving. The flow speed will determine how long the water will be in contact with the mine walls, and hence the heating time. In this case, heat will predominantly flow in the two directions perpendicular to the flow direction, so, assuming diffusion of heat into a laminar flow of water will govern the heat transfer in this case (an assumption that could easily be challenged!), we have to consider the 2-D heat equation \n",

Dividing by $\\Delta T$, and substituting $\\Delta y = \\Delta z = 1$ m (half the width or height of the mine tunnel), gives a minimum heating time of $\\displaystyle \\Delta t = \\frac{2}{\\kappa}$. This requires a maximum velocity $\\displaystyle v = \\frac{1000}{2/\\kappa} = 500 \\kappa$. Using $\\displaystyle \\kappa = \\frac{k}{\\rho C_P} \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-7}$ ${\\mathrm m^2/sec}$, this gives a velocity of approximately $7 \\times 10^{-5}$ m/s, or about 6 m/day."
