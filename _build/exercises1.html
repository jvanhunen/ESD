<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From the definition of heat flow (q) given in the lecture, determine the units of the parameter $k$ (thermal conductivity). The answer should be given in standard SI units - see handout on common material parameters. Add your answers to your parameter handout sheet.</li>
<li>Assume a thermal conductivity $k = 4$ (in the units you just calculated in part a. Make assumptions for the thickness of a typical continental lithosphere, the surface temperature and the mantle temperature to estimate the typical heat flow through this lithosphere. Ignore radiogenic heating.</li>
<li>Suppose we would be able to capture this heat. How large a surface area would we need to run a $40$ W lightbulb?</li>
<li>If the whole Earth would be covered with such continental lithosphere, what would be the total heat flow out of the Earth?</li>
<li>Compare this to the total surface heat flow of the real Earth, which is around $40$ TW = $40 \times 10^{12}$ W. How does this compare to your estimate in the previous question, and what could be the reasons for any discrepancy?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From the diffusion equation, determine the units for thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$. The answer should be given in standard SI units - see handout on common material parameters. Add your answers to your parameter handout sheet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: estimating diffusion time- and length scales</strong><br>
Quick estimates can be made on the length- and time scale of heat transfer processes by approximating the differentials from the heat equation (see slide 16 of lecture notes).</p>
<ol>
<li>Use this technique to estimate the approximate diffusive cooling time for the whole mantle (given that the mantle is ~3000 km thick). Is this cooling time likely to be an underestimate or overestimate of the Earth's cooling time and why?</li>
<li>A county council in the UK is considering using abandoned mines as geothermal heat source. To achieve that, they consider injecting cold water at one end of an abandoned mine tunnel. The mine tunnel has a width and height of 2 m, and is 1 km long, and the mine walls are significantly warmer than the injected water. How slow will the water have to move through the tunnel so that it has enough time to warm up to approximately the mine wall temperature before reaching the mine exit? Assume that water has a heat capacity of 4200 J/kg,K, a density of 1000 $\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, and a conductivity of 0.6 W/m,K.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: estimating diffusion time- and length scales 2: penetration of periodic surface temperature fluctuations</strong><br>
Use the same technique as in the previous exercise to estimate:</p>
<ol>
<li>the penetration depth of daily and annual temperature fluctuations.</li>
<li>Using separation of variables, an exact, analytical solution can be obtained for the penetration of heat from a surface that heats and cools periodically, of which the solution is: 
$$
T = T_0 + \Delta T \exp{\left(-z \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2 \kappa}}\right)} \cos{\left(\omega t -z \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2 \kappa}}\right)},
$$
with $z$ the depth below the surface, $T_0$ the average surface temperature, $\Delta T$ the periodic temperature fluctuation around the average, and  $\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{\tau}$ the circular frequency related to the period $\tau$ of the fluctuation. The 'skin depth' of the temperature fluctuation is defined as the depth where the fluctuations have decreased in amplitude by a factor  $\displaystyle \frac{1}{e}$ . Calculate the skin depth for daily and annual temperature fluctuations, and compare your answers to those in part a.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: competition between advection and diffusion at mid-ocean ridges</strong><br>
At mid-ocean ridges, advection of upwelling material tends to heat up this area, while diffusion of heat through the surface tends to cool it down.</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine which terms of the heat equation in section <a href="heat_equation.html#A-more-complete-heat-equation">A more complete heat equation</a> are relevant for this situation.</li>
<li>Use again the technique of approximating the differentials to provide again a simple order-of-magnitude approximation equation (as on slide 16).</li>
<li>Estimate the approximate thickness of lithosphere at the mid-ocean ridge for a slow- ($\sim 1$ cm/yr) and fast-spreading ridge ($\sim 10$ cm/yr).</li>
<li>Can you think of any potential shortcomings in this order-of-magnitude estimate?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: the significance of radiogenic heat production</strong><br>
It is often stated that radiogenic heat production is important in continents, but negligible in oceanic mantle lithosphere. Let's investigate this, using the simplified heat equation in the <a href="heat_equation.html#Heat-production">Heat Production</a> section.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Table from Fowler (see lecture notes slide 20) to look up how much heat is generated in peridotite. Assuming that this heat does not diffuse away, but stays trapped, what would be the local temperature increase over 1 Myr? Assume a local heat capacity $C_P$ of 1000 J/kg,K.</li>
<li>How much would this be over the typical lifespan of oceanic lithosphere? Is this a significant temperature increase?</li>
</ol>

<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$\displaystyle q = -k\frac{dT}{dz}$, where $q$ (in $\displaystyle \mathrm{\frac{W}{m^2}}=\frac{J}{m^2 s}$) is heat flow, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\displaystyle \frac{dT}{dz}$ (in K/m) is the spatial derivative of temperature in $z$-direction. So the units of $k$ are W/m,K $=$ J/s,m,K.</li>
<li>With a lithosphere thickness of $100$ km = $10^5$ m, and a temperature of the surface and the mantle of 0 and 1000 $\mathrm {}^oC$, respectively, this gives \ 
$q = -4\times(1000-0)/10^5 = -0.04 \mathrm{W/m^2}$, or 40 $\mathrm {mW/m^2}$. </li>
<li>$40$ W / $0.04$ $\mathrm{ W/m^2}$ = $1000$ $\mathrm{m^2}$, about the area of the Earth Science building. So the Earth is releasing quite a lot of energy.</li>
<li>Multiply 0.04 $\mathrm{W/m^2}$ by $4\pi r^2$ surface area of Earth, with r=6371 km = 6371,000 m. This gives around $2\times10^{13}$ W = $20$ TW. </li>
<li>Because no heat production assumed, and because oceanic lithosphere is thinner, so has a higher heat flow.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$T$ has units of $K$, $t$ has units of $s$, and $x$ has units of $m$. Therefore $\kappa$ has units of $\mathrm {m^2/s}$.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: estimating diffusion time- and length scales</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If heat would only transport by diffusion and only vertically upwards, the heat equation would reduce to the one-dimensional diffusion equation 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$. Approximating the differentials gives $\displaystyle \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2}$, which reduces to $\displaystyle \Delta t = \frac{\Delta z^2}{\kappa}$ or $\Delta z = \sqrt{\kappa \Delta t}$. Using $\Delta z = 3000$ km = $3\times 10^6$ m and $\kappa=10^{-6}$ $\mathrm {m^2/s}$, cooling the mantle takes approximately $\Delta t=9 \times 10^{18}$ s = 285 Gyrs, more than 60 times the age of the Earth. This is clearly an overestimate: Earth does not only use diffusion to transport heat, but advection as well (which expresses itself as plate tectonics, more about this later). This will speed up the cooling significantly.</li>
<li>The simplest way to solve this is to assume a reference frame that moves with the water, so that, in that reference frame, the water is not moving. The flow speed will determine how long the water will be in contact with the mine walls, and hence the heating time. In this case, heat will predominantly flow in the two directions perpendicular to the flow direction, so, assuming diffusion of heat into a laminar flow of water will govern the heat transfer in this case (an assumption that could easily be challenged!), we have to consider the 2-D heat equation 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$. Approximating the differentials gives 
$\displaystyle \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta y^2} + \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2}$. Dividing by $\Delta T$, and substituting $\Delta y = \Delta z = 1$ m (half the width or height of the mine tunnel), gives a minimum heating time of $\displaystyle \Delta t = \frac{2}{\kappa}$. This requires a maximum velocity $\displaystyle v = \frac{1000}{2/\kappa} = 500 \kappa$. Using $\displaystyle \kappa = \frac{k}{\rho C_P} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-7}$ ${\mathrm m^2/sec}$, this gives a velocity of approximately $7 \times 10^{-5}$ m/s, or about 6 m/day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: estimating diffusion time- and length scales 2: penetration of periodic surface temperature fluctuations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Heat only transports by diffusion in these cases, so the heat equation reduces to 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$. 
Approximating the differentials gives $\displaystyle \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2}$, which reduces to $\displaystyle \Delta t = \frac{\Delta z^2}{\kappa}$ or $\Delta z = \sqrt{\kappa \Delta t}$. 
Penetration depth of daily heat (roughly 12 hours of heating, 12 hours of cooling)  is (using $\kappa=10^{-6}$ ${\mathrm m^2/s}$ ) = 21 cm, and for yearly heat (half a year of heating, half a year of cooling) is $\sim 4$ m. 
Note that these answers are order-of-magnitude estimates only, so more than one significant figure/digit in the answer is probably not justified.</li>
<li>The amplitude of the fluctuation is controlled by the 
$\displaystyle \exp{\left(-z\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2 \kappa}}\right)}$ part of the solution. A daily fluctuation has a period of 24 hours, which can be translated into $\displaystyle \omega = \frac{2 \pi}{\tau}$. Setting $\displaystyle \exp{\left(-z\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\kappa \tau}}\right)} = \frac{1}{e}$ gives  $\displaystyle z=\sqrt{\frac{\kappa \tau}{\pi}}$. For daily and yearly fluctuations, this gives a skin depth of 17 cm and 3.2 m, respectively. These values are somewhat lower than the rough estimates in part a, but still comparable. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: competition between advection and diffusion at mid-ocean ridges</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Relevant terms are diffusion and advection terms in $z$-direction only, since the MOR is in approximate steady state, and radiogenic heat production is not important on the short timescale. So:<br>
$\displaystyle \kappa \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} - v_z\frac{dT}{dz} = 0$.
\item Approximating the differentials gives $\displaystyle \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2} - v_z\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z} = 0$, or $\displaystyle \Delta z = \frac{\kappa}{v_z}$.
\item Using $\kappa=10^{-6}$ $\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and 1 cm/yr and 10 cm/yr as slow- and fast spreading rates, this gives an approximate thickness of 3000 m and 300 m, respectively.<ol>
<li>Potential shortcomings are 1) the negligence of latent heat of crustal solidifications, 2) slow spreading ridges are probably not in steady state, and 3) cooling from hydrothermal circulation.

<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: the significance of radiogenic heat production</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Without diffusion or advection, the heat equation reduces to: $\displaystyle \frac{dT}{dt}=\frac{H}{C_P} = 2x10^{-12}$ J/kg,s / 1000 J/kg,K = $2 \times 10^{-15}$ K/s = $0.063$ K/Myr.</li>
<li>This is about 6 K over the 100-Myr lifespan of oceanic lithosphere. This illustrates that radiogenic heating is negligible in oceanic mantle lithosphere.  </li>
