<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$\displaystyle q = -k\frac{dT}{dz}$, where $q$ (in $\displaystyle \mathrm{\frac{W}{m^2}}=\frac{J}{m^2 s}$) is heat flow, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\displaystyle \frac{dT}{dz}$ (in K/m) is the spatial derivative of temperature in $z$-direction. So the units of $k$ are W/m,K $=$ J/s,m,K.</li>
<li>With a lithosphere thickness of $100$ km = $10^5$ m, and a temperature of the surface and the mantle of 0 and 1000 $\mathrm {}^oC$, respectively, this gives \ 
$q = -4\times(1000-0)/10^5 = -0.04 \mathrm{W/m^2}$, or 40 $\mathrm {mW/m^2}$. </li>
<li>$40$ W / $0.04$ $\mathrm{ W/m^2}$ = $1000$ $\mathrm{m^2}$, about the area of the Earth Science building. So the Earth is releasing quite a lot of energy.</li>
<li>Multiply 0.04 $\mathrm{W/m^2}$ by $4\pi r^2$ surface area of Earth, with r=6371 km = 6371,000 m. This gives around $2\times10^{13}$ W = $20$ TW. </li>
<li>Because no heat production assumed, and because oceanic lithosphere is thinner, so has a higher heat flow.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: deriving units of physical parameters</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$T$ has units of $K$, $t$ has units of $s$, and $x$ has units of $m$. Therefore $\kappa$ has units of $\mathrm {m^2/s}$.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key ideas/concepts: estimating diffusion time- and length scales</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If heat would only transport by diffusion and only vertically upwards, the heat equation would reduce to the one-dimensional diffusion equation 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$. Approximating the differentials gives $\displaystyle \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2}$, which reduces to $\displaystyle \Delta t = \frac{\Delta z^2}{\kappa}$ or $\Delta z = \sqrt{\kappa \Delta t}$. Using $\Delta z = 3000$ km = $3\times 10^6$ m and $\kappa=10^{-6}$ $\mathrm {m^2/s}$, cooling the mantle takes approximately $\Delta t=9 \times 10^{18}$ s = 285 Gyrs, more than 60 times the age of the Earth. This is clearly an overestimate: Earth does not only use diffusion to transport heat, but advection as well (which expresses itself as plate tectonics, more about this later). This will speed up the cooling significantly.</li>
<li>The simplest way to solve this is to assume a reference frame that moves with the water, so that, in that reference frame, the water is not moving. The flow speed will determine how long the water will be in contact with the mine walls, and hence the heating time. In this case, heat will predominantly flow in the two directions perpendicular to the flow direction, so, assuming diffusion of heat into a laminar flow of water will govern the heat transfer in this case (an assumption that could easily be challenged!), we have to consider the 2-D heat equation 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$. Approximating the differentials gives 
$\displaystyle \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta y^2} + \kappa \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta z^2}$. Dividing by $\Delta T$, and substituting $\Delta y = \Delta z = 1$ m (half the width or height of the mine tunnel), gives a minimum heating time of $\displaystyle \Delta t = \frac{2}{\kappa}$. This requires a maximum velocity $\displaystyle v = \frac{1000}{2/\kappa} = 500 \kappa$. Using $\displaystyle \kappa = \frac{k}{\rho C_P} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-7}$ ${\mathrm m^2/sec}$, this gives a velocity of approximately $7 \times 10^{-5}$ m/s, or about 6 m/day.</li>

<li>Heat only transports by diffusion in these cases, so the heat equation reduces to 
$\displaystyle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}$.

Penetration depth of daily heat (roughly 12 hours of heating, 12 hours of cooling)  is (using $\kappa=10^{-6}$ ${\mathrm m^2/s}$ ) = 21 cm, and for yearly heat (half a year of heating, half a year of cooling) is $\sim 4$ m.

<li>The amplitude of the fluctuation is controlled by the 
$\displaystyle \exp{\left(-z\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2 \kappa}}\right)}$ part of the solution. A daily fluctuation has a period of 24 hours, which can be translated into $\displaystyle \omega = \frac{2 \pi}{\tau}$. Setting $\displaystyle \exp{\left(-z\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\kappa \tau}}\right)} = \frac{1}{e}$ gives  $\displaystyle z=\sqrt{\frac{\kappa \tau}{\pi}}$.
